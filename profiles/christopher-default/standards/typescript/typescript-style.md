## Typescript best practices

- **Interfaces for Args**: If a function is exported from the file and has more than 1 argument, then write an interface for the args above the function and also export it.
- **Exports at end of file**: Write the exports at the bottom of the file, rather than at the delcaration spot
- **Entrypoints Directory**: I prefer to have an entrypoints directory in `src/entrypoints` that is the starting point for each runtime we have. This can be ignored when using more opinated frameworks like nextjs, where this rule doesn't apply.
- **Prefer functions over classes**: Use functions instead of classes for most logic, components, or utilities—especially for stateless behavior, simple data transformations, or when you only need to organize helpers. Only introduce a class when you truly need to model complex entities with state, leverage inheritance or polymorphism, or manage life cycles. Avoid defaulting to classes for structural reasons; functions are usually more transparent and easier for both humans and AI agents to read, modify, and test.
- **Use `index.ts` in a folder only when needed**: Only create a folder with an `index.ts` file if there are multiple related files that need to be grouped together. The `index.ts` should serve as a central export point for those files. If a folder contains only an `index.ts`, this usually means it should be refactored: move the code into a single file (for example in a `services/`, `utils/`, or directly in `src/` if appropriate). Avoid unnecessary folder and `index.ts` structures—prefer flat, descriptive organization.
- **Config with zod in config.ts**: At the root of `src/`, create a `config.ts` file. Use `zod` to define and validate all required environment variables, set any defaults, and store hardcoded values. This makes all configuration in one place—easy for both humans and AI to read, update, and use consistently across the project.
- **Remove Unused Dependencies**: If a dependency is no longer used in the project, remove it from `package.json`, uninstall it, and update any lock files. Make sure to also clean up any related type definitions and imports in your codebase.
